# 📝 Blog Section Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the **Blog/Journal Section** in my developer portfolio.  
The goal is to document everything I learn daily — for future me and to help others too.  
It’ll be built with good software engineering practices in mind, ensuring modularity, reusability, and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

- I tend to forget things like how to configure NGINX, deploy apps, etc.
- Documenting my learning helps reinforce understanding.
- It builds my **personal knowledge base**.
- Sharing it in public can help others struggling with the same problems.
- It makes my portfolio more authentic and useful.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **React** (my portfolio is built with React)
- **React Router** or **Next.js** (for routing)
- **Markdown (.md)** files for blog content
- **react-markdown** for rendering markdown into React components
- Optional: **Frontmatter** in Markdown using `gray-matter` for metadata

## 📦 Folder Structure

```bash
/blog
├── index.jsx            # Lists all blog posts
├── [slug].jsx          # Dynamic route for each blog post
├── BlogCard.jsx        # Preview card for a blog post
├── BlogPost.jsx       # Full post renderer using react-markdown
└── posts/
    ├── fixing-nginx.md
    ├── setting-up-ssh.md
    └── learning-vite.md
```

## 🧩 Components Breakdown

### 1. `BlogCard.jsx`

- Displays a summary of a blog post: title, date, and short snippet.
- Used in the blog listing page (`index.jsx`).
- Props:
  - `title`
  - `date`
  - `description`
  - `slug`

---

### 2. `BlogPost.jsx`

- Loads and renders a full `.md` blog post using `react-markdown`.
- Handles the display of:
  - Markdown content
  - Code blocks
  - Images
  - Links
  - Headings

---

### 3. `index.jsx`

- Reads metadata from all `.md` files (title, date, slug).
- Loops through the files and renders a `BlogCard` for each post.
- Acts as the main landing page for the blog section.

---

### 4. `[slug].jsx` (Dynamic Routing)

- Fetches the `.md` file based on the slug from the URL.
- Example URL: `/blog/fixing-nginx`
- Parses frontmatter + content and passes it to `BlogPost.jsx`.

---

## 📄 Markdown Files (Content)

- Stored in `blog/posts/`
- Written in Markdown with frontmatter at the top:

```md
---
title: "Fixing NGINX for APK Download"
date: "2025-05-14"
slug: "fixing-nginx"
tags: ["nginx", "deployment"]

## 🛠️ Tools / Libraries

| Tool               | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `react-markdown`   | Converts `.md` to JSX                    |
| `gray-matter`      | Parses frontmatter metadata from `.md` files |
| `highlight.js`/`prism` | Syntax highlighting (optional)        |
| `fs` and `path`    | Read `.md` files from disk (Next.js)     |

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Separation of concerns**: Each component does one thing well  
- **Modular design**: Easy to add new posts, edit layout, or refactor  
- **Readable URLs**: Slugs make links shareable and SEO-friendly  
- **Reusable components**: `BlogCard` and `BlogPost` can be reused across the app  
- **Version-controlled content**: Markdown files live in Git, easily editable  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add tags/categories and filter by them  
- Add search functionality  
- Enable comments (maybe via GitHub Discussions or a third-party service)  
- Export posts to public blogs like Hashnode or Dev.to  

## 📌 Summary

The blog section will be a living, evolving dev journal:  

- Helps me retain what I learn  
- Makes my portfolio stand out  
- Helps others who face the same issues  
- Super easy to maintain — just write Markdown and commit
